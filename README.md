Api Annie helps your team to co-ordinate easier when developing a product which needs API comunication, by going through the following steps:
1. **[Define]** Define your API structure.
2. **[Mock]** Frontend developer makes their prototype by using the mock server automatically generated by Api Annie.
3. **[Execute]** Backend developer builds the backend services and test it by sending requests through Api Annie
4. **[Integrate]** When both frontend and backend development are finished, let frontend switch communication from Api Annie to your backend server URL.
